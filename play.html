        <h5>Lady Windermeres Fan</h5>

        <h6>ACT III.  _Lord Darlington’s rooms_</h6>

        
        <p>DUMBY.  And her income, Tuppy?  Has she explained that?

            LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_In a very serious voice_.]  She’s going to explain that
            to-morrow.
            
            [CECIL GRAHAM _goes back to C. table_.]
            
            DUMBY.  Awfully commercial, women nowadays.  Our grandmothers threw their
            caps over the mills, of course, but, by Jove, their granddaughters only
            throw their caps over mills that can raise the wind for them.
            
            LORD AUGUSTUS.  You want to make her out a wicked woman.  She is not!
            
            CECIL GRAHAM.  Oh!  Wicked women bother one.  Good women bore one.  That
            is the only difference between them.
            
            LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Puffing a cigar_.]  Mrs. Erlynne has a future before
            her.
            
            DUMBY.  Mrs. Erlynne has a past before her.
            
            LORD AUGUSTUS.  I prefer women with a past.  They’re always so demmed
            amusing to talk to.
            
            CECIL GRAHAM.  Well, you’ll have lots of topics of conversation with
            _her_, Tuppy.  [_Rising and going to him_.]
